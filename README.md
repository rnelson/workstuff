# workstuff

Our servers are horribly outdated so I can't do things like nice plugins 
for vim that pull stuff down automagically. Also, the `/home` partitions 
on them are always nearly at capacity, so I can't build binaries and 
just copy those everywhere.

So this repository contains some minimal configs to make working on those 
machines a little less painful.

## Installation

```
$ curl -k https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rnelson/workstuff/master/install.sh | bash
